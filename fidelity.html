<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: center;">Issues with line (573) 860-2600:</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ff9900; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; padding: 3px 10px; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 5px;">MCI</span>&nbsp;as Long Distance carrier</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Calling any number outside of the 468-xxxx and 860-xxxx areas (anything Intra or InterLATA) results in a 'The number you are calling has recently been disconnected' message.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The problem seems to be caused by the improper setup of MCI as the long distance carrier on the number -- in addition to an issue regarding the provisioning of permissions to call Inter/IntraLATA and use Carrier Access/Dial-Around codes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The latter issue is tested and proven/exemplified by using a dial-around code (101/1010 code) to access known working carriers (e.g. AT&amp;T - 1010-288 <em>or</em> Fidelity's own dial-around code: 101-5640) -- which will work on other correctly provisioned Fidelity lines (such as my 573-860-6553 number), but result in a 'The number you have called has recently been disconnected.' message when tested on (573-860-2600).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once again, this is a misconfiguration of Feature Group D settings within the Fidelity 5ESS switch.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Issues with line (573) 860-6553:</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; padding: 3px 10px; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 5px;">Fidelity Long Distance</span>&nbsp;Route Quality Problems</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">All calls to country code +683 (Niue) are given a 'All routes to the country you are calling are busy now. Please try again later.&nbsp;<em>121-T!</em>' from the Hillsboro, MO No. 4ESS tandem switch. This is likely an issue with AT&amp;T's routes, or the routes they are providing to Fidelity Communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Using this same phone line (573-860-6553), calls to the Niue, when routed over MCI (using PIC (0222) or Dial-Around code (1010-222) go through successfully.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Digit-By-Digit Tandem Translations&nbsp;<em>or</em> Number Translations @ Fidelity 5ESS</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Calls to about 8 countries fail after dialing the country code.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For example 011-998 (international exit code + country code for Uzbekistan) immediately goes to a fast busy (reorder tone) after the country code. This can be caused by the country code translation not being programmed into the Fidelity 5ESS, or the tandem (Hillsboro, MO 4ESS, or other switches) being sent dialed numbers on a digit-by-digit basis, and rejecting the call once it knows it's going to Uzbekistan, which could be a carrier issue.</p>
