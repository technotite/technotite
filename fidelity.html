<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Current Issues Regarding Fidelity Telephone Landline Service</h1>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Issues with line (573) 860-2600:</h2>
<h3><span style="background-color: #339966; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; padding: 3px 10px; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 5px;">CenturyLink</span> as Long Distance carrier</h3>
<p>Calling any number outside of the 468-xxxx and 860-xxxx areas (anything Intra or InterLATA) results in a 'The number you are calling has recently been disconnected' message.</p>
<p>The issue seems to be caused by the improper setup of CenturyLink/Qwest as the LD carrier -- in addition to an issue regarding permissions to call Inter/IntraLATA, as well as potentially an issue with regard to Fidelity's mapping of the Carrier Access Code (CAC) '0432' for CenturyLink to the correct carrier (CenturyLink/Qwest).</p>
<p>The latter two issues are proven and exemplified by two testing procedures. The permissions issue is tested when using a dial-around code (101/1010 code) to access known working carriers (MCI - 1010-220/1010-222 &amp; AT&amp;T 1010-288) -- which work on other permission-enabled Fidelity lines (such as my 573-860-6553 number), but result in a 'The number you have called has recently been disconnected.' message when tested on (573-860-2600). The issue with the correct mapping of Carrier Access Code (CAC/PIC) '0432' is tested by dialing 101-0432-1-700-555-4141 on a known good Fidelity line (573-860-6553). The carrier subscription message from CenturyLink should be played, however, a message from another carrier plays. The message that plays is 'Thank you for using Sage Long Distance. One, four. One, four.'. CenturyLink/Qwest confirms this is an error in the mapping of their carrier access code on Fidelity's 5ESS, and they have confirmed after SS7 traces that my calls are not leaving Fidelity's switch.</p>

<h2>Issues with line (573) 860-6553:</h2>
<h3><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; padding: 3px 10px; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 5px;">Fidelity Long Distance</span>&nbsp;Route Quality Problems</h3>
<p>All calls to country code +683 (Niue) are given a 'All routes to the country you are calling are busy now. Please try again later.&nbsp;<em>121-T!</em>' from the Hillsboro, MO No. 4ESS tandem switch. This is likely an issue with AT&amp;T's routes, or the routes they are providing to Fidelity Communications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Digit-By-Digit Tandem Translations&nbsp;<em>or</em> Number Translations @ Fidelity 5ESS</h3>
<p>Calls to about 8 countries fail after dialing the country code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example 011-998 (international exit code + country code for Uzbekistan) immediately goes to a fast busy (reorder tone) after the country code. This can be caused by the country code translation not being programmed into the Fidelity 5ESS, or the tandem (Hillsboro, MO 4ESS, or other switches) being sent dialed numbers on a digit-by-digit basis, and rejecting the call once it knows it's going to Uzbekistan, which could be a carrier issue.</p>
