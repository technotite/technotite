<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>2600 Hz 1VF (Single Frequency) Signaling in East Ukraine</strong></em></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Research About The Switch:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The exchange sits in the East of Ukraine, and evidence suggests that it is likely electromechanical. It has prominent relay sounds, as well as characteristic 2600 signaling that indicates the age of the equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It appears that the exchange uses 2600 hz supervision in some capacity, and uses single-frequency (1VF) dial pulsing from the main electromechanical (<em>crossbar?</em>) office to the tributaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Historically, in this region of the former Soviet Union, ATSK 100/2000 crossbar exchanges would have been used to serve a larger area of subscribers, and act as a main switch for tributaries. It is likely that this switch is indeed an ATSK 100/2000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to budget constraints in the 90's, Ukrtelecom used a method of compromise. Rather than upgrade all of the switches in their network to digital, they used their budget to retrofit existing electromechanical switches with custom-made computerized billing and control. This helped Ukrtelecom bring newer calling features and better performance to a region with communications infrastructure far behind the rest of the western world. This switch was likely computerized during this period of infrastructure upgrades, and certain behaviors with regard to routing support this theory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The main exchange occupies the zone code; the first 4 digits after the country code (011 380 ZONE), and the tributaries are enumarated by the next two numbers (TT). Individual subscribers (SUB) will be the last 3 digits -- this allows for 999 numbers per tributary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a whole, this would be expressed as (011 380-ZONE-TT-SUB).&nbsp; This configuration may be specific to this older electromechanical switch cluster.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dial outpulsing to the tributaries only includes the last three subscriber-identifying (SUB) digits. The dial pulsing used in this switch cluster seems to obey the following rules:</p>

<p><em><strong>SEIZURE TONE LENGTH (900 MS)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>SILENCE AFTER SEIZURE (900 MS)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>2600 PULSE LENGTH (55 MS)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>PAUSE BETWEEN DIAL PULSES (55 MS)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>INTER DIGIT SILENCE LENGTH (900 MS)</strong></em></p>

<p>This recording is a seemingly successful</p>
<p>attempt at SFing the crossbar in the Ukraine.</p>
Dialed digits would have been 2-1-1-1.<hr />
